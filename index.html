				<p>I decided to try a commercial technique to see if more plants, makes more yield in the same area.... cut to the chase, no, it didnt. It saves maybe a week at most and was more agro than it was worth. I will never be trying this experiment ever ever again!
					Second part of this test was to see if Dinafem BC was as good a producer as Exo luton cut. The result was Dina BC dwarfed the exo and was more frosty. It is also more of a head high imho, but I did cut at 8.5 weeks flower.
					Exo was clones from flowering plant, BC was all seeds. There were 2 obvious phenos - one was tall and fat with few stems, other was tall and skinny with many.
					Final result was 66 zips + a load of popcorn.</p>
